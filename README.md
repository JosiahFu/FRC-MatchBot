A discord bot to get match and event data from FRC competitions


## Installation

Install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads)

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add the bot token under the system environment variable `MATCH_BOT_DISCORD_TOKEN`.

In Windows (replacing `TOKEN` with your token):

```
  setx MATCH_BOT_DISCORD_TOKEN TOKEN /m
```

Then run the bot from the main script:

The bot will remain active while the script is running. You can also use [Replit](https://replit.com) and [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to run the bot continously.
